              Throughout this project, I explored the core design of AngularJS through extending the functionality of web apps with
              dependency injection to reuse existing AnagularJS services, as well as create custom services designed with unique functionality.                                                   Background data binding to give reusability to HTML elements, and ways to extend the HTML syntax with directives. I tied this project together
              with SPA multiple views implemented through routing and used several methods to unit test this functionality. Applied all these
              AngularJS specificities to build a fully functional, well-organized, and tested web application deployed on the cloud with Heroku.

We learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. From the ground up, we learned how to implement modern web pages with             HTML5 and CSS3. We then advanced to learning how to code our pages such that their components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the                userâ€™s screen. Lastly, we were introduced to Javascript and used it to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side       
            functionality and data to the end user.</p>
